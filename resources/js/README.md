# Shopno Property - Material UI React (TypeScript) Scaffold

What you get:
- Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold
- Material UI v5 setup
- A Property context with mocked data (`src/data/mockProperties.ts`)
- Pages and components:
  - Header
  - Home (grid of PropertyCard)
  - PropertyDetailDialog (modal)
  - PropertyContext (simple state + add/get)
- Placeholders for images in `public/assets/`

How to run:
1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- This scaffold assumes you'll export images (jpg/png) from your Figma file and place them in `public/assets/` named `house1.jpg`, `house2.jpg`, `house3.jpg`.
- If you want me to extract actual assets and create pixel-perfect components from the uploaded .fig, tell me and I'll try to extract layers and SVGs next.
