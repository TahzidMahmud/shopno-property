FILES TO UPLOAD FOR NEW STORAGE SYSTEM

   → This is the core file that handles all uploads

2. app/Http/Controllers/PropertyController.php
3. app/Http/Controllers/FacilityController.php
4. app/Http/Controllers/BlogPostController.php
5. app/Http/Controllers/PartnerController.php

14. app/Http/Controllers/FooterController.php

OPTIONAL FILES (Recommended):
------------------------------

15. public/storage/.htaccess
    → Will be created automatically, but you can upload this to ensure it's correct

16. public/setup.php
    → Only if you want to re-run the setup wizard

================================================================================
QUICK UPLOAD OPTIONS:
================================================================================

OPTION 1 (Easiest - Upload Entire Folders):
--------------------------------------------
Upload these entire folders:
  - app/Services/
  - app/Http/Controllers/

This ensures ALL files are updated.

OPTION 2 (Selective - Upload Individual Files):
------------------------------------------------
Upload only the 14 files listed above.

================================================================================
AFTER UPLOAD - VERIFY:
================================================================================

1. Create public/storage/ directory (if it doesn't exist)
   → Set permissions to 755

2. Test: Upload a new image through admin panel
   → Should appear in public/storage/uploads/
   → Should be accessible via /storage/uploads/... URL

3. Check: New uploads work immediately (no sync needed)

================================================================================
EXISTING FILES:
================================================================================

If you have existing files in storage/app/public/uploads/:
  → Copy them to public/storage/uploads/ manually via cPanel
  → OR leave them (they'll work if already accessible)
